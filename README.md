# Calc 
This is a project that was a part of the Odin Project. The goal was to learn JavaScript and DOM Manipulation and get a good grasp of JavaScript. I 
could use some work with the styling however it is responsive to the resolution of the screen which is something I found very confusing, but I understand it now. 
The JavaScript works well, I plan on making it so that you can put in as many operators as you want, so you can do 3 * 5 / 5 + 6 without having to press equal 
each time. I also want to add to the display screen so that you can see your previous number.
